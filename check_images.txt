Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: 
Yes

2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: 
No, the VGG model architecture classify it as siamese cat, the Alexnet model architecture classify it as triceratops, and the ResNet model architecture classify it as gibbon or hylobates lar

3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: 
Yes

4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer:
Based on the class that is classified, all models have almost similar capabilities. But in terms of speed, Alexnet is the fastest with a classification time of only one second, followed by ResNet at four seconds, and VGG at 8 seconds.
